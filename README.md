# hello-world
I'm not quite sure what I'll do with this repository, but I'd like to learn the basics of GitHub!
I think I'm supposed to add a bit about myself here – my name is Chloe Mintz, I'm a third-year at NU double-majoring in journalism and economics with a minor in creative writing. (I've recently learned NU is a top 6 university – how crazy!)
